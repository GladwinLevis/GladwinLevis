I’m Gladwin Levis. I’m a college student learning programming in a very grounded way. Right now, my priority is not speed or trends, but understanding fundamentals properly and building habits that actually last.

---

These days I spend most of my time practicing problem solving and revisiting core concepts. I work on small programs, college projects, and basic implementations that improve my logic. I’m still improving, still fixing mistakes, and deliberately keeping things simple while I strengthen my foundation.

Skills (still learning):  
Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, basic SQL, data structures fundamentals, object-oriented programming basics, basic backend concepts
