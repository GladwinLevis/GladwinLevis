I’m Gladwin Levis. I’m a college student who’s still learning how things really work in programming. Right now my focus is not on building flashy projects, but on understanding fundamentals clearly — logic, structure, and why a solution works instead of just making it pass.

---

Most of my time goes into practicing problem solving and revisiting core concepts. I work on small programs, college-level projects, and basic implementations that help me think better as a programmer. I’m intentionally keeping things simple, because I’m still building my foundation and I don’t want gaps later.

Skills (learning phase):  
Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, basic SQL, data structures fundamentals, object-oriented programming basics, simple backend concepts
