I’m Gladwin Levis. I’m a college student who’s still learning how to think clearly as a programmer. Right now, I’m more interested in understanding fundamentals properly than rushing into advanced stacks. I spend most of my time practicing, failing, fixing, and slowly getting better.

Lately, my focus has been on consistency. I solve problems regularly, revise basic concepts, and work on small academic or personal projects whenever possible. I’m trying to build discipline and clarity first, even if progress feels uneven. Still learning, still improving, still working on the basics.

Skills (work in progress):  
Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, basic SQL, data structures fundamentals, object-oriented programming basics, basic backend concepts
